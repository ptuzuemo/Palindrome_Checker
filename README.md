The Palindrome Checker is a simple web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables users to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Features

2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the `palindrome.html` file in a web browser.
4. Enter a string in the input field.
5. Click the 'Check Palindrome' button.
6. A notification will appear below the button indicating whether the entered string is a palindrome or not. If it is a palindrome, the notification will be green; otherwise, it will be red.
